This fork contains experimental branches for implementing async support into Django. The branches are prefixed with ``async-experiment-``. Latest branch supports running an ASGI server to handle HTTP requests, async-capable views and responses (including form POST bodies).

The experiments here are intended to help inform any potential roadmap for async-support in Django's core.
