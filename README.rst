This fork contains experimental branches for implementing async support into Django. The working branches are prefixed with ``async-experiment-``, the ``async`` branch contains the most "stable"/usable version. 

Currently supports ASGI server to handle HTTP requests, async-capable views and responses.

The experiments here are intended to help inform any potential roadmap for async-support in Django's core (if that ends up moving forward).
